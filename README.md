# Military Object Detection Project

## Overview

This project detects various objects in a military video clips, including army personnel, weapons, aircraft, shoes, and tanks using the YOLOv5 object detection model.

The YOLOv5 model is a state-of-the-art object detection model that is fast and accurate. It can detect objects in real-time and is widely used in various applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, and robotics.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Step 2: Write a Detailed Report

Create a `report.pdf` with the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly describe the project and its objectives.
2. **Methodology**: Explain the YOLOv5 model and how it was used.
3. **Implementation**: Describe the steps to implement the object detection.
4. **Results**: Include the results and analysis.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize the project and future work.

### Step 3: Capture Screenshots
